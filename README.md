# Real-Time-Automotive-Dashboard-Development-Using-CAN-Protocol
Developed a real-time automotive dashboard to monitor and display critical vehicle parameters (speed, temperature, etc.) by interfacing with the CAN bus. The system was implemented on an ARM-based microcontroller (LPC2129) and tested on the RHYDOLABZ development board, ensuring reliable data acquisition and visualization.
